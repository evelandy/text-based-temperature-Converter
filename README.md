# text based temperature Converter
This version converts temperature from fahrenheit to celsius as well as celsius to fahrenheit as a text based application. There is also a GUI based application that does the same thing elsewhere in the repo. 

To use just download/fork the file and run via terminal/command prompt. After starting the program enter the temperature that you wish to convert and press enter. The next prompt will ask you to press C) celsius or F) fahrenheit, after you make your choice press enter and you will get your converted temperature on the screen. The app will then ask you if you would like to check another temperature. You can choose to continue with another or end the program. 

Thank you for visiting!
